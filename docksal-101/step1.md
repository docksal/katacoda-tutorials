To install Docksal use the following command:

`curl -fsSL https://get.docksal.io | CI=true bash`{{execute}}

Setup a directory for your projects:

`mkdir ~/projects`{{execute}}

Open the "vhost-proxy" tab. You should see the following image there for now:

![vhost-proxy](http://i.imgur.com/nt9ZFBt.jpg)

This is OK and means there are no running projects yet.

Proceed to the next step to launch your first project stack.
